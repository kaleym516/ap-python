1. my program is about photography taking pictures of animals,people and self potrait photos of people and getting paid good money while doing it.the problem I am trying to solve will be if people want professional photos i could take very good ones for them and give the people what they want.Then come up with good ideas while doing them such as creative backgrounds and different themes.

2. things would be finding background themes,taking,asking to take picture of animal or person,and asking if they want different angles to do.

3. yes because you have instagram,Lightroom, Iphone camera and google to find out how to do everything. and youtube to get steps.

4. Do you want to take picture of animal or person. selcet 1 for taking pictures of animals select 2 for animals select 3 for different angles on how you want it.

first for what you need i would get bussiness cards giving it out to people at my school or even just walking around giving people bussiness cards.Next I would make a twitter and instragram showing people my work and promoting the photography page then make a website with bookings and times to do people photo shoots. that will be my project and what I would be working.
